# Examples showing RPi.GPIO and gpiozero libraries

Examples showing how to turn on an LED using the gpiozero library and RPi.GPIO libraries

## Installation

RPi.GPIO and gpiozero should already be installed by default on a base installation of Raspbian. But for some reason, you don't have gpiozero installed, install it with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-gpiozero
```
